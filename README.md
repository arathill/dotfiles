# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for personal use as well. Not intended to be maintaned as high quality config files.

Many modifications may not work well when copied without any reflection about. Feel free to write to me if any help is needed. 

## VIM

VIM configuration file is rather collection of fancy config statements found on internet than purposely written dot-file. Nevertheless it can be reviewed and copied in parts if needed.

## Vivaldi minimal UI

Although it is far to be called an dot-file, vivaldi.common.css provides simple and, one may say, hard coded rules to make Vivaldi User Interface feel minimal. It was inspired by qutebrowser simplicity and can be simply applied within Vivaldi CSS rules. Please consider this file was written and tested only in Arch Linux & Openbox enviroment. With simple modifications should be usable on Mac OS and Windows as well.

### Other

ZSH and bash are just there.
